# WorkoutPlan

Contributers: |Tyler Fontana|Aaron McFeaters|John Burke|  
  
Project Goal:  
The purpose of our website is to create a user-based workout regimen that is tailored to the users’ goals that they inputted. The user’s geolocation will be retrieved through JavaScript so our website can check dynamically to see whether the weather in their area is fit for outdoor based workouts such as running. The Web Geolocation API will be used in handling the geolocation work. Moreover, we will be using the national weather service’s weather API in order to find out the weather information. The information that will be retrieved from the database will include all the workouts as well as user information such as their username, password, and their created workouts. The user then will also have the ability to modify their workouts after creating them so our database will be normally retrieving and changing that data. If the user doesn’t create an account, they will only have access to viewing workouts individually across the website based on what they are looking to train (Abs, Biceps, Chest, Cardio, etc.…) to reach a particular goal, however that goal may be more of a broad goal then a tailored one. The non-registered users will not be able to have any information saved and will not be able to create personalized workout plans. Such features will be only available to users who have created an account.  
  
To run: run routes.py using a python Flask interpreter.
